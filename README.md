# Background
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, emerged in late 2019 and rapidly spread across the globe, leading to unprecedented health, economic, and social challenges. Governments and health organizations worldwide have been tracking and analyzing data to understand the virus’s spread, impact, and to inform public health responses. This Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19’s global impact, highlighting key metrics such as confirmed cases, deaths, and infection rates across different regions.

# Global Numbers
Confirmed Cases: 150,574,977
Deaths: 3,180,205

# Total Cases Per Continent
North America: Highest number of cases
Europe: Second highest
Asia: Significant number of cases
South America: Also heavily impacted

# Percent Population Infected per Country
The world map indicates varying infection rates across countries, with darker shades representing higher percentages of the population infected. This visualization helps identify the most affected countries relative to their population size.
Percent Population Infected (Line Graph)
This graph shows the infection rates over time for selected countries, highlighting trends and peaks. For example, countries like the USA and Italy show significant spikes at different times, reflecting waves of the pandemic.
Percent Population Deceased (Line Graph)
This graph tracks the death rates over time for selected countries. It provides insights into the mortality impact of COVID-19, showing how death rates have changed over time and between countries.

# Results and Insights
High Impact Areas: North America and Europe have been significantly impacted in terms of total cases.
Infection Trends: The line graphs indicate that certain countries experienced sharp increases in infection rates at different times, reflecting waves of the pandemic.
Mortality Trends: The death rate graph shows how mortality has varied over time and between countries, influenced by factors like healthcare quality, public health measures, and virus variants.
