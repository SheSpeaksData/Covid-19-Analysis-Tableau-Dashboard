# Global Numbers
Confirmed Cases: 150,574,977
Deaths: 3,180,205

# Total Cases Per Continent
The bar chart shows the distribution of total COVID-19 cases across different continents. It appears that North America and Europe have the highest number of cases, followed by Asia and South America.
Percent Population Infected per Country
The world map uses color coding to indicate the percentage of the population infected by COVID-19 in various countries. Darker shades likely represent higher infection rates. This visualization helps identify which countries have been most affected relative to their population size.
# Percent Population Infected (Line Graph)
This graph tracks the infection rates over time for selected countries. It shows trends and peaks in infection rates, which can be useful for understanding the progression of the pandemic in different regions.
Percent Population Deceased (Line Graph)
Similar to the infection rate graph, this one tracks the death rates over time for selected countries. It provides insights into the mortality impact of COVID-19 and how it has changed over time.

# Insights
High Impact Areas: North America and Europe have been significantly impacted in terms of total cases.
Infection Trends: The line graphs indicate that certain countries experienced sharp increases in infection rates at different times, reflecting waves of the pandemic.
Mortality Trends: The death rate graph shows how mortality has varied over time and between countries, which could be influenced by factors like healthcare quality, public health measures, and virus variants.
